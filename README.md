# Report.NET
The Report.NET class library is used to generate precise PDF documents. The code is written in C# for the .NET platform and
includes sample code for ASP.NET that can be used to create dynamic PDF-response pages.

This project is a fork of Otto Mayer's Report.NET class library that was originally posted on Source Forge
under http://sourceforge.net/projects/report/.

Although this fork has made a few minor improvements to the original code, the primary purpose of this repo is to create NuGet packages for various flavors of .NET: 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Report.NET/.

Although you can commonly use the original .NET 2.0 DLL downloaded from SourceForge in later versions of .NET without issues, under some circumstances race conditions will occur when loading the .NET 2.0 framework assembly side-by-side within a later version of .NET when executing Report.NET code that will cause unhandled exceptions. This repository exposes all .NET Framework versions, from 2.0 to 4.8 as well as .NET core versions 3.1, 5.0 and 6.0 -- the stated exceptions do not occur when using a version of the Report.NET assembly that is compiled against the same .NET version as the deployed application.

> If you are looking for other options for open source PDF generation, e.g., non-LGPL licensed, the following C# library developed by Uzi Granot looks pretty good: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/570682/PDF-File-Writer-Csharp-Class-Library-Version-1-25 - it uses a [CPOL](https://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx) license. This alternate library already has a NuGet package that can be found here: https://www.nuget.org/packages/PdfFileWriter/

## Project Description

Report.NET is a powerful library that will help you to generate PDF documents in a simple and flexible manner. The document
can be created with data that has been retrieved from any ADO.NET data set. The Report.NET library is available for free
under the LGPL license.

Start Samples with Visual Studio .NET

1. Create a folder for the Report.NET project e.g. C:\Report.NET
2. Copy folder ReportSamples to C:\Report.NET\ReportSamples
3. Copy folder Root to C:\Report.NET\Root
4. Copy Inetpub\wwwroot\ReportSamplesASP to C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ReportSamplesASP
5. Start the administration panel of the IIS
5. Select "Internet Information Services Start" -> "YourPC (local computer)" -> "Default Web Site" -> ReportSamplesASP
6. Open the properties dialog of ReportSamplesASP
7. Click on the "Create" button and check the "Read" box
8. Open the solution C:\Report.NET\ReportSamples\ReportSamples.sln
 
## Samples

The executable program files (.exe) of all samples are in ReportSamples\bin. The samples can be executed directly if the
Microsoft .NET Framework has been installed.
